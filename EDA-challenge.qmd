## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse","usethis")
library(tidyverse)
library(usethis)
## these functions load necessary packages into R for subsequent lines.
f <- file.choose()
## The file.choose pathway is being left blank, so when the dialog box opens you should navigate to and select "data-wrangling.csv" from your local files
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE)
## this should load the dataset as an object of 213 observations with 23 variables
d$BSD <- (d$Body_mass_male_mean / d$Body_mass_female_mean)
d$sex_ratio <- (d$AdultFemale / d$AdultMales)
d$home_diameter <- (sqrt(((d$HomeRange_km2)/pi))*2)
d$DI <- (d$DayLength_km / d$home_diameter)
## these four lines create four new variables which will be used in later steps.
```
