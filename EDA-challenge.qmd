## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse","usethis")
library(tidyverse)
library(usethis)
## these functions load necessary packages into R for subsequent lines.
f <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ada-datasets/refs/heads/main/data-wrangling.csv"
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE)
## this should load the dataset as an object of 213 observations with 23 variables
d$BSD <- (d$Body_mass_male_mean / d$Body_mass_female_mean)
d$sex_ratio <- (d$AdultFemale / d$AdultMales)
d$home_diameter <- (sqrt(((d$HomeRange_km2)/pi))*2)
d$DI <- (d$DayLength_km / d$home_diameter)
## these four lines create four new variables which will be used in later steps.
ptime_day <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x=Move, y=DayLength_km)) + geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) + labs(title = "Time Spent Moving vs Day Range Length", y= "Day Range", x= "Time Moving")
ptime_day_family <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x=Move, y=DayLength_km)) + geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) + facet_wrap(~ Family) + labs(title = "Time Spent Moving vs Day Range Length", y= "Day Range", x= "Time Moving")
##these steps create two plots. One is a single plot, the other generates a set of scatter plots. In each the X axis represents time spent moving and the y axis represents the day range length. Each scatter plot contains data, where available, for individual Families.##
psize_day <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x=MeanGroupSize, y=DayLength_km)) + geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) + labs(title = "Mean Group Size vs Day Range Length", y= "Group Size", x= "Time Moving")
psize_day_family <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x=MeanGroupSize, y=DayLength_km)) + geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) + facet_wrap(~ Family) + labs(title = "Mean Group Size vs Day Range Length", y= "Group Size", x= "Time Moving")
##these steps create two plots. One is a single plot, the other generates a set of scatter plots. In each the X axis represents the mean group size and the y axis represents the day range length. Each scatter plot contains data, where available, for individual Families.##
pcanine_dimorph <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x=Canine_Dimorphism, y=BSD)) + geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) + labs(title = "Canine Size Dimorphism vs Body Size Dimorphism", y= "Body Size Dimorphism", x= "Canine Dimorphism")
pcanine_dimorph_family <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x=Canine_Dimorphism, y=BSD)) + geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) + facet_wrap(~ family) + labs(title = "Canine Size Dimorphism vs Body Size Dimorphism", y= "Body Size Dimorphism", x= "Canine Dimorphism")
##these steps create two plots. One is a single plot, the other generates a set of scatter plots. In each the X axis represents the canine size dimorphism and the y axis represents the body size dimorphism. Each scatter plot contains data, where available, for individual Families.##
